# BTC Pullback Ends: Do Altcoins Still Have a Chance to Rise?

The cryptocurrency market has undergone significant shifts following Donald Trump's U.S. presidential election victory. As Bitcoin (BTC) breaks free from a six-month consolidation phase and surges past critical price thresholds, investors face pressing questions about market dynamics. This article examines technical analyses, macroeconomic factors, and trader sentiment to determine whether altcoins still hold potential in the current landscape.

## Market Context: Trump's Election Impact

Since Trump's election win, cryptocurrency narratives have evolved dramatically. The market now operates under the "crypto golden age" framework, with reduced regulatory fears following the SEC's softened stance. Key developments include:

- Tesla and Trump Media Group experiencing extreme "Trump trade" volatility
- BTC reaching record highs above $90,000 without significant corrections
- Whale liquidations totaling $100M+ during bullish momentum

While BTC maintains strong support at the 4-hour EMA20 level, the Nasdaq's five-day correction signals potential market fatigue. This divergence creates uncertainty about the sustainability of both BTC's rally and altcoins' recovery prospects.

## Technical Analysis Perspectives

### Biupa: Macro Correlation Matters
Market analyst Biupa highlights the inverse relationship between OTHERS.D (altcoin dominance index) and DXY (U.S. Dollar Index). Over 49 days of observation:
- OTHERS.D: Falling channel pattern
- DXY: Rising channel formation

Key Insight: Altcoins remain vulnerable while dollar-BTC policy-driven rallies continue. A DXY reversal may precede meaningful altcoin rebounds.

### Cryptos Laowai: Bull Market Timing
This analyst argues that genuine bullish momentum requires Trump's formal policy implementation post-2025. Current conditions suggest:
- Potential "double fakeout" pattern formation
- CME gap at $76,000 as primary target for corrective action
- Caution against expecting widespread altseason phenomena

### Crypto Painter: Four BTC Scenarios
Quantitative strategist Crypto Painter identifies critical BTC price levels:
| Scenario | Price Level | Implication |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Bullish Continuation | >$90K | Uptrend maintenance |
| Range Formation | <$90K | Sideways phase |
| Constructive Pullback | <$85K | Buying opportunity |
| Extreme Correction | <$85K rejection | CME gap test |

Pro Tip: Watch for BTC's response to $85,000 support â€“ this level determines near-term market structure validity.

## Altcoin Analysis: Historical Precedents

1. BTC consolidation period
2. Peak BTC dominance
3. Subsequent altcoin outperformance

Key Takeaway: Quality altcoins like BNB and SOL historically outperform during BTC stabilization phases. Strategic accumulation remains viable despite current BTC dominance.
