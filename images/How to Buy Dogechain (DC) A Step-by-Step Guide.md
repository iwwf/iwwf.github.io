### 2. Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)

For users prioritizing autonomy, decentralized exchanges enable direct peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries. This method requires compatible crypto wallets and awareness of potential slippage risks. DEX platforms maintain blockchain-native security while preserving full asset control for traders.

### 3. Peer-to-Peer Trading

P2P marketplaces connect buyers directly with sellers, supporting diverse payment methods including bank transfers and digital wallets. While offering flexibility, these platforms necessitate careful evaluation of seller reputations and escrow services to ensure transaction safety.

**Beginner recommendation**: Centralized exchanges remain the most accessible option for first-time buyers due to their intuitive interfaces and comprehensive support systems.
