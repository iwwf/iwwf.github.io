# ETH vs WETH: What's the Difference?

## Understanding ETH and WETH

Ethereum (ETH) and Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) are foundational elements of blockchain technology and decentralized finance (DeFi). While they share a 1:1 value ratio, their technical distinctions enable unique functionalities across ecosystems. This guide explores their differences, use cases, and practical applications.

## The Role of ERC-20 Standard

### Why WETH Was Created
Ethereum's native cryptocurrency, ETH, predates the **ERC-20 token standard**â€”a protocol that governs how tokens interact within the Ethereum ecosystem. ETH lacks full ERC-20 compliance, limiting its integration with decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi protocols. To bridge this gap, **WETH** was developed as an ERC-20-compliant wrapper for ETH.

### Key Differences Between ETH and WETH
| Feature                | ETH                          | WETH                          |
|------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Token Standard**     | Non-ERC-20                   | ERC-20                        |
| **Use in DeFi**        | Limited                      | Seamless integration          |
| **Transferability**    | Native to Ethereum           | Compatible with multiple dApps|
| **Price**              | $X                           | Mirrors ETH ($X)              |

WETH acts as a "bridge," enabling ETH holders to participate in liquidity pools, yield farming, and other DeFi activities without selling their native ETH.

## How to Convert ETH to WETH

Converting ETH to WETH involves a simple process using decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like **Uniswap** or **SushiSwap**. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Connect Your Wallet**: Use MetaMask or Coinbase Wallet to access a DEX.
2. **Select Token Pair**: Choose ETH/WETH on the swap interface.
3. **Approve Transaction**: Confirm the conversion via your wallet.
4. **Receive WETH**: The equivalent amount of WETH appears in your wallet.

## FAQs: Addressing Common Questions

### Q1: Can I Use WETH on Blockchains Other Than Ethereum?
Yes! WETH can be bridged to networks like Binance Smart Chain (BSC) or Polygon via cross-chain protocols. However, ensure the receiving chain supports ERC-20 tokens.

### Q2: Is WETH Safer Than ETH?
Both are secured by Ethereum's blockchain. However, WETH relies on smart contracts, so audit history and liquidity pool security should be verified.

### Q3: Why Do dApps Require WETH Instead of ETH?
Most dApps are built for ERC-20 tokens. WETH simplifies transactions by adhering to this standard, avoiding the need for custom ETH integrations.

## Security Considerations for Wrapped Tokens

Wrapped tokens like WETH depend on custodians (e.g., smart contracts or multisig wallets) to lock native assets during the wrapping process. While decentralized solutions like **WBTC** use DAOs for oversight, users should assess the custodian's reputation and audit history to mitigate risks like theft or mismanagement.

## Use Cases in DeFi

### 1. **Liquidity Provision**
WETH is widely used in liquidity pools on platforms like Uniswap. Providing WETH/DAI liquidity earns users trading fees and yield.

### 2. **Yield Farming**
Protocols like Aave and Compound allow users to stake WETH as collateral to borrow other assets or earn interest.

### 3. **NFT Transactions**
Many NFT marketplaces (e.g., OpenSea) accept WETH for seamless trading, bypassing the need to convert ETH for each transaction.

## Expanding the Ecosystem: Wrapped Tokens Beyond Ethereum

The concept of wrapped tokens isn't limited to ETH. For example:
- **WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin)**: Enables BTC holders to participate in Ethereum DeFi.
- **Binance-Pegged Tokens**: Allow BSC users to interact with cross-chain assets.

This interoperability fuels cross-chain DeFi growth, with the total value locked (TVL) in wrapped tokens exceeding $10 billion in 2024.

## Future of Wrapped Tokens

As blockchain networks evolve, solutions like **Polkadot** and **Cosmos** aim to achieve native interoperability. However, wrapped tokens will remain critical for legacy systems and niche use cases. Innovations like **Programmable Wrapping**â€”where tokens adapt to multiple standards dynamicallyâ€”could further enhance their utility.

## Conclusion

ETH and WETH serve complementary roles in the blockchain ecosystem. While ETH remains Ethereum's core currency, WETH unlocks DeFi participation through ERC-20 compliance. By understanding their interplay, users can optimize their strategies in decentralized finance.
