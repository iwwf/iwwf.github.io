## #1 U.S. Treasury Yields Surge: Pressure on Risk Assets  

### Understanding the Treasury Yield Impact  
U.S. Treasury yields have surged to multi-year highs, driven by stronger-than-expected economic data. Key indicators include:  
- **Nonfarm Payrolls**: Exceeded forecasts at 275,000 jobs added in January 2025  
- **Wage Growth**: Annualized rate held steady at 4.3%  

These figures reduced market confidence in near-term Federal Reserve rate cuts, pushing the probability of no rate change at the January 29 FOMC meeting to 95%. Even March and May rate cuts now appear less than 50% likely.  

### Market Reaction to Yield Shifts  
The 10-year Treasury yieldÁ™ÅÁ†¥ 4%, creating a strong gravitational pull for capital away from risk assets. This shift explains:  
- **$12.7 billion** outflow from crypto markets in January 2025  
- **DXY Index** (U.S. Dollar Strength) rising 3.2%  
- Gold and USD gaining safe-haven appeal over Bitcoin

## #2 Trump‚Äôs Tariff Resurgence: Global Trade Uncertainty  

### Policy Details and Economic Implications  
Former President Trump‚Äôs reinvigorated tariff strategy targets:

| Mexico  | 25%         | Agricultural goods |  
| Canada  | 20%         | Steel, aluminum |

## Frequently Asked Questions  

**Q: Why did Ethereum fall below $3,300?**  
A: Combined pressure from rising Treasury yields, Fed rate uncertainty, and macroeconomic volatility drove institutional selling of ETH, breaking key technical support levels.  

**Q: How do Treasury yields affect cryptocurrency prices?**  
A: Higher yields make bonds more attractive than risk assets. This capital rotation reduces liquidity in crypto markets, particularly impacting Ethereum‚Äôs DeFi-focused ecosystem.

A: Key catalysts include:  
- Fed rate cut announcements (mid-2025)
