## When Does Cryptocurrency Taxation Apply?  

Tax obligations depend on the nature of your crypto activities. Key scenarios include:  

### Taxable Events  
1. **Selling cryptocurrencies** (e.g., BTC to GBP).  
2. **Exchanging cryptocurrencies** (e.g., ETH to ADA).  
3. **Using crypto to purchase goods/services**.  
4. **Donating crypto** (excluding gifts to spouses or charities).  

### Non-Taxable Events  
- Transferring crypto between personal wallets/exchanges.  
- Receiving crypto as a gift from a spouse/civil partner.  

### Capital Gains Tax Exemptions  
The UK offers a **Capital Gains Tax (CGT) allowance** for crypto profits:  
| Tax Year        | CGT Exemption |  
|-----------------|---------------|  
| 2022â€“2023       | Â£12,300       |  
| 2023â€“2024       | Â£6,000        |  
| 2024â€“2025+      | Â£3,000        |  

Profits below these thresholds are tax-free.

## Calculating Capital Gains and Losses  

### Step-by-Step Process  
1. **Determine acquisition cost**: Purchase price + transaction fees.  
2. **Calculate disposal value**: Sale price or fair market value at the time of use.  
3. **Subtract costs from proceeds**: Profit = Disposal value â€“ Acquisition cost.  

### Example  
- Buy 1 BTC for Â£20,000 (including fees).  
- Sell 1 BTC for Â£30,000.  
- Profit: Â£10,000.  
- Taxable amount: Â£10,000 â€“ Â£3,000 (2024â€“2025 exemption) = Â£7,000.  

### Offsetting Losses  
Capital losses can reduce taxable gains. For instance, a Â£2,000 loss offsets gains up to the CGT exemption. Losses can be carried forward indefinitely.

## Specific Crypto Scenarios and Tax Implications  

### Crypto-to-Crypto Trades  
Exchanging ETH for SOL is a taxable event. Use the **fair market value** of the received asset to calculate gains.  

### Mining and Staking  
Rewards are taxed as **income** at their GBP value on receipt. Subsequent disposal triggers CGT.  

### Airdrops and Forks  
- **Airdrops**: Taxable as income if received for specific actions (e.g., social media promotion).  
- **Hard forks**: No income tax, but cost basis transfers to new tokens.  

### DeFi Transactions  
Adding/removing liquidity or earning yield in DeFi protocols may incur:  
- **Income tax** (if rewards are predictable).  
- **Capital gains tax** (if tokens are sold or swapped).  

### Lost or Stolen Crypto  
- **Lost keys**: No tax deduction unless you file a negligible value claim.  
- **Stolen crypto**: Not deductible as a loss, but no CGT liability.

## Tax Deductions for Crypto Investors  

### Allowable Deductions  
1. **Transaction fees**: Broker fees, network fees.  
2. **Professional costs**: Tax advisor fees, crypto tax software subscriptions.  
3. **Hardware wallets**: Costs directly related to holding crypto.  

### Example  
A Â£500 transaction fee on a Â£10,000 BTC purchase reduces taxable gain to Â£9,500.
