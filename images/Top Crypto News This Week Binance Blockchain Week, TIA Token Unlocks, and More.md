The crypto world continues to evolve rapidly, with major developments poised to reshape market dynamics. This week’s focus includes high-impact events like Binance Blockchain Week, significant token unlocks, and ecosystem updates. Let’s explore these stories in detail.  

## Celestia (TIA) Token Unlock: A Market Catalyst  

The Celestia (TIA) ecosystem faces a critical moment on **October 30**, with a massive token unlock event. Key details include:

- **Daily Linear Unlocks**: An additional 998,320 TIA tokens (~$5.13 million) will be released daily.  

This event affects **79.68% of TIA’s circulating supply**, raising concerns about potential selling pressure. Historically, token unlocks often precede price volatility, as holders may cash in their holdings. Investors should monitor market sentiment and consider hedging strategies ahead of this milestone.  

**FAQ**:  
**Q: Why are token unlocks often bearish?**  
A: Large unlocks increase supply, potentially causing short-term price drops if holders sell immediately. However, long-term value depends on ecosystem growth.
