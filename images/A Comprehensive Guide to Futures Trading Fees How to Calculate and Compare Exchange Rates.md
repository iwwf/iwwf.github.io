## Calculating Futures Trading Fees: Step-by-Step  

Use this formula for precise calculations:  
**Total Fee = (Contract Value Ã— Exchange Rate) + Brokerage Fee**  

### Example: Rebar Steel Trade  
1. **Contract Details**:  
   - Price: Â¥4,000/ton  
   - Lot Size: 10 tons  
2. **Exchange Fee**:  
   - 10 tons Ã— Â¥4,000 Ã— 0.1â€° = Â¥4  
3. **Brokerage Fee**: Â¥5 (hypothetical rate)  
4. **Total Cost**: Â¥4 + Â¥5 = **Â¥9**
