# Cardano Price Prediction | Insights into Short-Term and Long-Term Outlooks  

## What is Cardano?  
**Cardano** is a layer-1 blockchain platform designed to offer a scalable and secure infrastructure for decentralized applications (dApps). Founded by Charles Hoskinson, it utilizes the **proof-of-stake (PoS)** consensus mechanism, known as **Ouroboros**, to reduce energy consumption while maintaining network security through staking.  

Launched in 2017 at $0.01925, **ADA** (the native token) surged to $0.3884 in April 2018, marking an 1838% increase. However, the 2018 bear market forced ADA to retreat to $0.1, where it remained until late 2020. By November 2020, it broke out and reached an all-time high of **$3.09 in September 2021**. Despite subsequent volatility, ADA has retained investor confidence, with many anticipating a repeat of its 2020â€“2021 rally.
