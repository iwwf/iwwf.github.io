# Perpetual Futures Contract Guide: What Is a Perpetual Contract?

## Understanding Perpetual Futures Contracts

Perpetual futures contracts (often called "perps") have revolutionized cryptocurrency trading by offering leveraged exposure to digital assets without expiration dates. This comprehensive guide explores their mechanics, advantages, risks, and practical applications for both novice and experienced traders.

### Core Components of Perpetual Contracts

1. **No Expiration Date**  
   Unlike traditional futures, perpetual contracts allow indefinite position holding. This eliminates the need for contract rollovers, streamlining long-term speculative strategies.

2. **Funding Rate Mechanism**  
   A critical feature maintaining price alignment with spot markets through periodic payments between long and short positions. Positive/negative rates incentivize market equilibrium:
   - **Positive Funding Rate**: Bulls pay bears (bullish bias)
   - **Negative Funding Rate**: Bears pay bulls (bearish bias)

3. **Leverage Capabilities**  
   Platforms like BTCC offer up to 250x leverage, enabling amplified returns (and risks) compared to spot trading.
