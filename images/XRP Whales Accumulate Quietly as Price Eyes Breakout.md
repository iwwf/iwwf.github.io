# XRP Whales Accumulate Quietly as Price Eyes Breakout  

The cryptocurrency market has always been a dynamic ecosystem where large investors, known as "whales," play a pivotal role in shaping price movements. Recently, XRP has become a focal point of whale activity, with significant on-chain transactions signaling potential price momentum. This article explores the current accumulation patterns, technical indicators, and market sentiment surrounding XRP's potential breakout above the $2.20 resistance level.  

## Whale Activity Surpasses $915 Million in a Week  

On-chain data reveals a striking trend: XRP whales have accumulated over **420 million tokens** (valued at **$915 million**) within a single week. This surge in institutional-grade buying suggests strong confidence in XRP's long-term value despite recent price volatility. Notably, this accumulation coincided with a **6% price rally** to $2.23, driven by **108 million XRP traded in one hour**.  

However, retail participation appears muted. New wallet creation has dropped to a two-month low, indicating that smaller investors are adopting a wait-and-see approach while whales consolidate their positions. This divergence between institutional and retail behavior often precedes significant price movements in crypto markets.  

### Strategic Whale Transactions: Ripple and Coinbase Movements  

Key transactions highlight the strategic nature of whale activity:  
- **Ripple's $439 million transfer**: On June 18, Ripple moved **200 million XRP** to an unknown wallet, potentially for institutional partnerships or liquidity provisioning.  
- **Coinbase inflows**: Over **80 million XRP** ($175 million) was transferred from unknown wallets to Coinbase on June 12, 15, and 19, likely signaling profit-taking or preparation for larger trades.  
- **Undisclosed transfers**: **230 million XRP** moved from Ripple to an unknown wallet, and **50 million XRP** shifted between two unidentified addresses, further indicating behind-the-scenes accumulation.  

These movements underscore the growing influence of whales in shaping XRP's supply dynamics.  

## XRP Eyes $2.20 Breakout Amid Rising Network Activity  

While XRP trades sideways at **$2.18**, technical indicators suggest a potential breakout. The cryptocurrency has gained **3.6% in 24 hours** and **2.7% weekly**, recovering from a dip below $2.00. Crucially, the **200-day moving average (SMA)** now aligns with the $2.20 resistance level, making it a critical threshold for sustained bullish momentum.  

### On-Chain Metrics Signal Strengthening Fundamentals  
- **Wallet growth**: The number of wallets holding over **1 million XRP** reached a record **2,850**, reflecting increased institutional adoption.  
- **Active addresses**: Daily active addresses spiked by **442.7%** to **181,000**, signaling heightened network usage and potential use cases.  
- **Volume dynamics**: On-chain transaction volume has surged, with buyers absorbing sell pressure during recent dips.

## Technical Outlook: Neutral Signals with Bullish Catalysts  

The short-term technical picture remains cautiously optimistic:  
- **MACD**: The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line has crossed above the signal line, indicating strengthening bullish momentum.  
- **EMAs vs. SMAs**: The 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) act as resistance at $2.20, while shorter-term Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) show bullish alignment.  
- **Support levels**: A sustained hold above **$2.10** would confirm buyer dominance, with targets at **$2.35** and **$2.50**.  

However, a rejection at $2.20 could trigger a retest of the **$2.05â€“$2.10 support zone**, creating a buying opportunity for long-term holders.
